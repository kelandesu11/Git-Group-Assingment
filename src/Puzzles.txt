Rubric of Old
An ancient cryptography is embedded into the door. Nine stones jut out of the wall in the pattern of a diamond, each with a strange symbol etched on its surface. From top to bottom the symbols are: A red sun, a yellow fish, a yellow bird, a blue sun, a purple moon, a green bird, a red hare, a green fish, and a purple hare.
Simply press the symbol that is not repeated.(i.e. the purple moon)
